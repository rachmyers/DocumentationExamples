# Documentation Examples
This repository contains sample user guides I've created. Except for one guide, I’m not able to include much of my work in my previous jobs, so most of the samples are from my experience as a graduate assistant for the Office of Institutional Research at MSU. Our office was taking over the process of adminstering the senior Exit Exam from the Assessment Office. My director placed me in charge of this process. At her request, I brought the exam from being administered in a paper format to an online format. When that was successful, I brought the exam from being proctored to unproctored. This process required a lot of research and documentation, which helped me begin my career as a technical writer.

## Command Center Admin User Guide
This is the one documentation sample I’m able to include from my current position. A company created software for us called Command Center. This software helps track potential student dropouts and prevent them. The company was not able to create user documentation until after several months that our users would start using it.

I was tasked with creating user documentation for three different user groups that had different levels of access to the software. To start, I worked with our main developer who was working as the liaison and tester with the outside company. He gave me access, and showed me how it worked. 

Next, I also attended training and demos given to our users. These trainings helped me see the tasks they would be performing. The questions they asked also helped identify areas of the documentation I would need to focus on.

By this point, I was able to start on the actual user guides. I was familiar with the user interface and knew how to complete the most common tasks. I was also able to impersonate users, so I knew what each user group had access to. I had to ensure that the screenshots and tasks were correct for each user group.

After I had written a draft, the developer and a project manager served as my reviewers to ensure that the documents were accurate. This document was intentionally left in a draft status.

## Informational Report
When I was a Graduate Assistant, my office was taking over administering the Exit Exam to seniors. I was tasked with researching the exam. What were the current processes in place? What would it take to change the exam from being paper-based and proctored to online and unproctored? All questions that the director wanted to know are included in the report, along with my findings at the time.

## Exit Exam Procedures
This guide covers mostly Exit Exam administrative procedures and actions that had to be completed in the student information system called Banner. This process included creating course sections, adding and dropping students, sending mass emails to students, etc.

## MSU Proctor Manual
I wrote this guide for the other graduate assistants who were helping me proctor exams. At this time, I had helped move the Exit Exam to proctored and online. We were administering the exams in a computer lab for students.

## New Program Proposal Procedure
One of the functions of the Office of Institutional Research was to send proposals for new programs from various departments to the Missouri Department of Higher Education (MDHE) for approval. I wrote this guide for the other graduate assistants in our office who assisted with this process. Prior to sending a proposal to MDHE, we had to ensure that departments had used the right template and completed all required information. Next, we had to properly format the document. Once everything was completed, we sent the proposal to MDHE.
